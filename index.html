<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Simplified Overwatch describes how to play each Overwatch character, in only a few simple words.</p>
<p>Note: This advice only works with ranks lower than Master. After that, more extensive guides are required for each character.</p>
<h1>General Advice</h1>
<ul>
  <li>When seeking out enemies, don't just look left and right; also look up and down.</li>
  <li>When dying quickly and often, consider playing closer to your team.</li>
  <li>The right time to use ult is usually if the other team ults, or if you're about to die, not if the fight is over.</li>
  <li>Wait for your team before going into a fight. If you're the only one left, try to escape.</li>
  <li>Be sure to aim for the head.</li>
</ul>
